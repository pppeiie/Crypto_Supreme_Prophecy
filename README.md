# Overview

[**Cryptophecy**](https://cryptophecy-5392d.web.app/), which stands for **Cryptocurrency Prophecy**, is a simple bet game developed using [Chainlink reference data contract](https://docs.chain.link/docs/using-chainlink-reference-contracts) at the backend side and React for the Web UI interaction.

Gamblers can come to play whenever and as many times as they want by guessing whether the **Bitcoin** exchange rate after 1 hour will raise, drop, or be unchanged and then betting an arbitrary amount of **Ethereum** (at least 0.01 ETH) for that prediction. If the actual exchange after 1 hour since the moment their requests were submitted matched their guess, the gamblers would be rewarded an amount of **2.9 times** their stake. Otherwise, they receive nothing.
